A lot of this code is based on

* [@lottepitcher](https://github.com/lottepitcher)'s code in [Admin Only Property](https://github.com/LottePitcher/umbraco-admin-only-property) which totally sparked this idea!
* [@leekelleher](https://github.com/leekelleher)'s code in [Contentment]() and Adnim Only which totally powers 50%+ of this package.

Honorable mention, inspiration and motivation goes to

* [@deanleigh](https://github.com/deanleigh) et. al. for [Wholething Fallback Text Property](https://github.com/wholething/wholething-fallback-text-property).
